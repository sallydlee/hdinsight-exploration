# Spark on HDInsight
In this mini-project, we're taking a look at Azure HDInsight which allows us to quickly deploy Spark clusters. After provisioning a Spark cluster, we uploaded a csv of Walmart stock data and added a Jupyter Notebook to the cluster. EDA on the data can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook. The picguide pdf provides some screenshots during the cluster creation process.
